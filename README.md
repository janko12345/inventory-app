# Inventory-app

## introduction

This is my third project with node. Intructions were derived from [The Odin Project Lesson](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/nodejs/lessons/inventory-application "odin inventory app instructions") as always. Predecessor of this project was [local library app](https://github.com/janko12345/express-local-library "git repo") where i studied express framework as well as mongodb with mongoose and it prepared me for this project.

# About app
    Application serves as clothing shop for customers, but too for admins to make adjustments to the database. It displays clothing items with their properties and allow to virtually "buy" them, which will just decrease its stock in the database. 
    
    Application is visually more appealing and a bit more interactive for admins. You may proceed on the page as admin if you submit the correct password.
